freeCodeCamp Front End Development Libraries project - Build a Markdown Previewer

This project was completed as part of freeCodeCamp's Front End Development Libraries certificate.

Originally built on Codepen with a starter template, migrating it to Github was a great opportunity to learn a bit more about updates to React, and processing JSX using Babel.
